# Sample for remote server listener

These scripts are just 2 quick PHP examples that show:
* Creating a file that logs the testing data to a database
* A file the polls the database for the results and renders them using Google Charts

The files are very crude and are intended to be a starting point for however you want to store & display the bandwidth data (assuming that you want the data logged remote from the device performing the bandwidth test).

## Sample Bandwidth Chart
![Bandwidth Chart](bandwidth-chart.png?raw=true "Bandwidth Chart")

## Sample Latency Chart
![Latency Chart](latency-chart.png?raw=true "Latency Chart")
